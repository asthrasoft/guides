# Applied Intelligence labs

The primary reason for the labs is to start the process of applying technology to solve real world problems and to explore opportunities that can leverate technology. This is obviously a bridge - without knowing technology, we are not sure how to use it. But at the same time, if we just know technology and dont use it right, it is of no relevance and value.

The applied intelligence labs will focus on 3 aspects
1. Competitions - Like kaggle competitions these are technical and are driven off a github repo.
2. Challenges - These are domain driven challenges ideally hosted by a startup and/or an interested entity.
3. Experiments - Experiments put together challenges and competitions and are innovative solutions that can solve a real-world problem.

Examples of competitions include cognitive services like VisionAI, TextAI (NLP), ConversationAI, SpeechAI, DocumentAI, SearchAI. It also includes other algorithms with associated datasets. (Note labs in general can also be non-AI labs and so datasets are not mandatory. As an example - labs can also be cloud labs, container labs, music labs, art labs, baking labs and so on. All of them will have a domain challenge which is then supported by a technical competition which when put together becomes an experiment in the real world)
